Bally AS-2518-35
================

From "Quench" on Pinside:
> The "720-37" U6 ROM used on Space Invaders removes support for 10,000 point
> scores (Space Invaders doesn't have them) and adds some alternate
> credit/coin settings.
> The "720-37" U6 ROM completely ignores dip switch 1 and dip switch 9 in the
> coins/credits settings (only uses the "Off" setting for both of these
> particular switches).
> The "720-35" and "720-37" U6 ROMs are otherwise identical.
